# AM-Modulator-and-Superheterodyne-AM-Receiver
An AM wave was generated with a carrier frequency of 999kHz and a modulating frequency of 5kHz (i.e. a 10kHz bandwidth). The AM signal was fed to an RF amplifier. A signal was generated at the local oscillator stage and when “mixed” or heterodyned with the RF signal produced the difference or intermediate frequency. This difference frequency at 455kHz was amplified by two IF stages (most of the sensitivity and selectivity found here). The AM detector now detected this signal. The detector also detected the modulating frequency at 5kHz.
